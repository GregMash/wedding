            <h4>Her Side</h4>
            <p class="alignLeft">I had never experienced that feeling I heard so often: “When you know, you just know.”
                I came to the
                conclusion that was hopeless romantic talk. Despite this, I didn’t give up the idea of meeting my
                person. I downloaded Bumble and gave myself one week to check it out. Good looks aside, Greg
                immediately caught my attention with his U of A alumni status. We both swiped right and voila- a
                match meant to bee. (Thank you, Bumble) I reached out with a “Bear Down” and our communication
                seamlessly continued. It was so easy to talk to Greg and soon enough, he was planning our first
                date.
                <br>
                <br>
                Greg was the ultimate gentleman and picked me up. When I saw him standing outside my apartment, I
                was pleasantly surprised. I saw a 6’1” handsome man walking towards me. (He didn’t mention his
                height. In my head- YES!!) Greg’s easy going attitude eased my nerves. Our first date was at an
                Italian restaurant where we ended up closing the place down. The date flew by and I remember when we
                said goodbye, he gave me the best hug. I walked up to my apartment and couldn’t stop smiling! I had
                really hoped he felt the same way. I wanted to text him and thank him for an amazing evening, but I
                didn’t want to seem too hasty. Instead, I called my mom to share and while we were talking, I
                received a text from Greg that I have saved to this day. He said to hell with the rules and said
                exactly what I wanted to say to him!
                <br>
                <br>
                It has been right from the very beginning. I was finally excited to say I believe in “When you know,
                you just know.” So thankful for our story and can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with my very
                best friend.

            <h4>His Side</h4>
            <p class="alignLeft">From the first time Laura appeared on my phone, all felt right. It began with
                lighthearted
                communication leading up to our first date. Then came the excitement and nervousness of that
                unforgettable night. Our connection was instantaneous and I experienced a feeling that was
                completely new to me. Soon after that night, we began dating and I would come to understand what
                that feeling was: falling in love and finding my person.
                <br>
                <br>
                Every day, I am still amazed by the exponential growth of that feeling.
                <br>
                <br>
                We spent the ensuing years deepening our love and becoming a part of each other's families. It's
                funny how so many things in life are complicated, but our relationship has been the greatest,
                easiest, and most sensible thing I have experienced.
                <br>
                <br>
                Laura and I lived in Denver for two years before briefly returning to Arizona. Recently, we landed
                ourselves back in Colorado, this time in Colorado Springs. I could not be more happy, proud, and
                excited to live out the rest of our adventures together.
                <br>
                <br>
                Laura and I spend our time traveling, hiking, skiing/snowboarding, listening to live music, and
                spending time with friends & family every chance we get. I have never had more fun than when I am
                with her and absolutely can't wait to spend my whole life with Laura.
                <!--Our conversation was so encapsulating that I completely lost track of time. About thirty minutes after the restaurant had closed, I noticed that we were the only two left in the restaurant and that the staff was almost done cleaning up. -->

                    in
                    Northern Arizona and have been married for over 38 years. She had a joyful childhood patrolling
                    the
                    neighborhood with her younger brother, Brett, and best friend, Kimberly. Laura excelled in piano
                    and
                    academics where she earned a scholarship to the University of Arizona. She graduated with a
                    Bachelor
                    of Science in Nursing with Psychology and Spanish minors. In college, she discovered a love for
                    global health where she became a volunteer and later coordinator for a HIV/AIDS education
                    program in
                    Tanzania, East Africa. Her first trip to Tanzania in 2010 changed her life forever. Her homestay
                    family in a Maasai village called Shiboro became one of her own and they continue to maintain a
                    strong bond with holiday phone calls sharing a lot of laughter, broken Swahili and English, and
                    singing. Laura was honored when they named twins after she and her father. She will always love
                    her
                    Tanzanian family and can't wait for Greg to meet them. Laura has extensively traveled abroad and
                    loves to learn about new cultures. She has been working as a nurse for 8 years and currently
                    works

                    Greg was born and raised in Tucson, AZ. He was fortunate to grow up watching the two best
                    role models of love, his parents Gene and Cindy. They currently live in Tucson
                    and have been married for over 36 years. It is truly a wonder and also his hope to make Laura
                    feel as loved and as happy as he has seen his parents be. Greg is the
                    youngest of three boys. Andrew and Peter are his wonderful older brothers. They grew up playing,
                    wrestling, fighting, and trying
                    to be ninjas. Greg loves playing sports, particularly volleyball, basketball, and swimming. Greg
                    attended the University of Arizona where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Accounting. After
                    college, Greg worked in retail management
                    until going back to the University of Arizona to learn software development. He now works as a
                    software engineer for a company that
                    specializes in sports medicine and soft tissue repair. Greg loves to
                    do a variety of activities, including traveling, backpacking, hiking, sports, board
                    gaming, video gaming, and concert-going with Laura by his side.
