            <h6>Her Side</h6>
            <p>I had never experienced that feeling I heard so often: “When you know, you just know.” I came to the
                conclusion that was hopeless romantic talk. Despite this, I didn’t give up the idea of meeting my
                person. I downloaded Bumble and gave myself one week to check it out. Good looks aside, Greg
                immediately caught my attention with his U of A alumni status. We both swiped right and voila- a
                match meant to bee. (Thank you, Bumble) I reached out with a “Bear Down” and our communication
                seamlessly continued. It was so easy to talk to Greg and soon enough, he was planning our first
                date.
                <br>
                <br>
                Greg was the ultimate gentleman and picked me up. When I saw him standing outside my apartment, I
                was pleasantly surprised. I saw a 6’1” handsome man walking towards me. (He didn’t mention his
                height. In my head- YES!!) Greg’s easy going attitude eased my nerves. Our first date was at an
                Italian restaurant where we ended up closing the place down. The date flew by and I remember when we
                said goodbye, he gave me the best hug. I walked up to my apartment and couldn’t stop smiling! I had
                really hoped he felt the same way. I wanted to text him and thank him for an amazing evening, but I
                didn’t want to seem too hasty. Instead, I called my mom to share and while we were talking, I
                receive a text from Greg that I have saved to this day. He said to hell with the rules and said
                exactly what I wanted to say to him!
                <br>
                <br>
                It has been right from the very beginning. I was finally excited to say I believe in “When you know,
                you just know.” So thankful for our story and can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with my very
                best friend.
            </p>

            <h6>His Side</h6>
            <p>From the first time Laura appeared on my phone, all felt right. It began with lighthearted
                communication leading up to our first date. Then came the excitement and nervousness of that
                unforgettable night. Our connection was instantaneous and I experienced a feeling that was
                completely new to me. Soon after that night, we began dating and I would come to understand what
                that feeling was: falling in love and finding my person.
                <br>
                <br>
                Every day, I am still amazed by the exponential growth of that feeling.
                <br>
                <br>
                We spent the ensuing years deepening our love and becoming a part of each other's families. It's
                funny how so many things in life are complicated, but our relationship has been the greatest,
                easiest, and most sensible thing I have experienced.
                <br>
                <br>
                Laura and I lived in Denver for two years before briefly returning to Arizona. Recently, we landed
                ourselves back in Colorado, this time in Colorado Springs. I could not be more happy, proud, and
                excited to live out the rest of our adventures together.
                <br>
                <br>
                Laura and I spend our time traveling, hiking, skiing/snowboarding, listening to live music, and
                spending time with friends & family every chance we get. I have never had more fun than when I am
                with her and absolutely can't wait to spend my whole life with Laura.
                <!--Our conversation was so encapsulating that I completely lost track of time. About thirty minutes after the restaurant had closed, I noticed that we were the only two left in the restaurant and that the staff was almost done cleaning up. -->

        <p class="poiret indent">Greg proposed at the Bison Golf Club near the Mash family cabin. Seeing Greg on one
            knee with my stunning ring felt surreal. I said absolutely and he continued to surprise me with both of our
            families awaiting at a nearby park. We all joyously celebrated with an amazing brunch. I will never forget
            that beautiful day full of love and family!

            <!--It was the first family Christmas at the beautiful Mash cabin in Showlow, AZ. Greg’s young
            niece and nephew were along and the family said they were headed to the park to let the kids play. Greg
            planned a breakfast date for he and Laura and they planned to meet the family later. They went to the
            Sweetheart Café, which Laura later learned she threw off his original plan a few times. After breakfast,
            Greg headed to the Bison Golf Club where Laura thought they were going for a scenic drive and a stop for
            photos. Greg drove around the area and Laura thought they were lost. Little did she know Greg was looking
            for balloons where his brother and sister-in-law, Pete and Kim, were incognito photographers/videographers.
            They pulled up to a cul-de-sac, walked up to the golf course, and Laura noticed there were balloons pink and
            white balloons blowing in the wind. She turned to Greg and he told her to look again. She turned once more
            to see the balloons said “Will you marry me?” Once she turned back around, Greg was on one knee with a
            beautiful ring. She said “Absolutely!” and then Pete and Kim ran out. After they moved past the tears and
            excitement, Greg said he had another surprise. They drove up to a beautiful ramada with a fireplace. The
            Reyes and Mash families were both awaiting where they all joyously celebrated their engagement with an
            amazing brunch. It was such a special time to have both families celebrating their love.
            <br><br> Laura and Greg can’t wait to celebrate their marriage with you! </p> -->
